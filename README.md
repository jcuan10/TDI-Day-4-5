# TDI-Day-4-5

For the milestone project, you will host a Git repository on GitHub that is capable of launching an instance of JupyterHub hosting a notebook file that contains your work from the pandas (Day 4) and plotting (Day 5) action items. Follow these steps:

Fork this repo that contains the files to get going with Binder. Forking is a process that creates a copy of the repo that lives on your own GitHub account. That way, you can work on the forked copy. You can read about forking and how it's done here.
Create and add a notebook file to the repository that contains the work of the action items of the days about pandas and plotting. In other words, the notebook should now be part of your forked Git repo. Note, any data files you used will need to be part of the repo.
Update the file requirements.txt. This file contains the third-party Python packages that are required to run the code in your notebooks. We already have a few packages listed but you may need to include at least one more. While the versions are not necessary, their inclusion will ensure that the specified version of the package is installed. By ensuring the exact version is installed, we can be more certain that our code will run and our results are reproducible. You can read more about the requirements.txt file here.
Update the Binder launch link in README.md. If you look at the raw README.md file, you will see that "launch binder" link points to the original repo and not your copy. Make sure to update your README.md with the link of your copy of the forked repo.
Push all of your changes to GitHub. If everything worked, then hitting the "launch binder" icon in the README.md will take you to a working instance of JupyterHub with the notebooks and files of your repo. Make sure to run your notebook to check that everything works.
